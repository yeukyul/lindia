Description: Provides a set of streamlined functions that allow
    easy generation of linear regression diagnostic plots necessarily 
    for checking linear model assumptions.
    This package is meant for easy scheming of linear 
    regression diagnostics, while preserving merits of 
    "The Grammar of Graphics" as implemented in 'ggplot2'.
    See the 'ggplot2' website for more information regarding the
    specific capability of graphics.
